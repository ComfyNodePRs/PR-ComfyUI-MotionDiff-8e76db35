# ComfyUI MotionDiff
Implementation of MDM, MotionDiffuse and ReMoDiffuse into ComfyUI

# Installation:
## Using ComfyUI Manager (recommended):
Install [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) and do steps introduced there to install this repo.

## Alternative:
If you're running on Linux, or non-admin account on windows you'll want to ensure `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes` and `comfyui_controlnet_aux` has write permissions.

There is now a **install.bat** you can run to install to portable if detected. Otherwise it will default to system and assume you followed ConfyUI's manual installation steps. 

If you can't run **install.bat** (e.g. you are a Linux user). Open the CMD/Shell and do the following:
  - Navigate to your `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` folder
  - Run `git clone https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux/`
  - Navigate to your `comfyui_controlnet_aux` folder
    - Portable/venv:
       - Run `path/to/ComfUI/python_embeded/python.exe -s -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
	- With system python
	   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Start ComfyUI
